//Coding Exercise:: Exam Result Checker
//You have been provided with an incomplete Java class named ExamResult. This class has a method
// isPass(int marks) which needs to be completed.
//
//The isPass(int marks) method should take an integer value representing the marks obtained by a student
// in an exam and determine whether the student has passed or failed the exam.
//
//In this case, a student is considered to have passed the exam if they have scored more than 50 marks.
// If the student's marks are 50 or less, they are considered to have failed.
//
//Instructions::
//
//Complete the isPass(int marks) method such that it returns a boolean value indicating whether
// the student has passed or not. This method should return true if the marks are greater than 50
// (indicating the student has passed), and false otherwise (indicating the student has failed).
//
//Be sure to consider edge cases such as a student scoring exactly 50 marks.
//
//Remember, the goal is to check if a student has passed or failed based on their marks. Good luck!
public class Udemy_Ex2_ExamResult {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

            System.out.println(true);
            return true;
